IMPORTANT — READ FIRST


- use sail for interacting with PHP

Phase 2 (Upload System) is production-ready and LOCKED.

You MUST:
- Read the Phase 2 documentation before making changes
- Treat all Phase 2 backend code as immutable
- NOT refactor, rename, move, or “clean up” any Phase 2 services, jobs, models, migrations, or events
- NOT modify UploadSession, Asset upload lifecycle, or S3 logic
- NOT introduce “improvements” or abstractions to Phase 2 code

Allowed work is LIMITED to:
- Phase 2.5: troubleshooting the temporary UI uploader ONLY
- UI wiring, bug fixes, and diagnostics
- Documentation and comments

If a backend issue is discovered:
- STOP
- Report it
- Do NOT refactor
