# Phase C — Metadata Governance & Visibility

Phase C introduces administrative and tenant-level governance
for metadata fields without modifying the underlying metadata engine.

---

## Scope Overview

This phase provides:
- Observability into system-provided metadata fields
- Controlled visibility and applicability management
- Clear separation between system fields and tenant fields
- Preparation for enterprise governance and monetization

This phase does NOT modify:
- MetadataSchemaResolver
- Field keys, types, or options
- Candidate resolution logic
- Approval workflows

---

## Phase Breakdown

### C1 — System Metadata Governance UI (Admin Only)
Status: ⏳ Pending

Goals:
- View all system metadata fields
- Inspect field definitions (read-only)
- Identify AI vs system vs manual fields
- Configure visibility (upload/edit/filter)
- Configure category suppression
- Observe usage & override statistics

No schema mutation allowed.

---

### C2 — System Visibility Enforcement
Status: ⏳ Pending

Goals:
- Enforce category exclusions in:
  - Upload UI
  - Edit UI
  - Filters
- Ensure consistent behavior across all contexts
- No ownership or duplication of fields

---

### C3 — Tenant Custom Metadata Fields
Status: ⏳ Pending

Goals:
- Allow tenants to define custom fields
- Enforce namespacing (e.g. custom__*)
- Enforce plan-based limits
- Prevent deletion once in use
- Visibility configurable per tenant

System fields remain immutable.

---

### C4 — Tenant Metadata Visibility UI
Status: ⏳ Pending

Goals:
- Tenant UI to manage visibility of:
  - System fields (visibility only)
  - Tenant-created fields
- Configure show/hide per context
- Configure category suppression (visibility only)

---

## Locked Principles

- Categories do not own metadata schemas
- Fields are global, visibility is contextual
- No versioning of metadata fields
- Overrides and candidates replace versioning
- All changes are additive and auditable

### Phase I: AI Metadata Generation

**Status:** 📋 PLANNING

AI metadata generation for `ai_eligible` fields is planned in **Phase I**. See `PHASE_I_AI_METADATA_GENERATION.md` for complete design specification.

**Key Points:**
- Only processes fields with `ai_eligible = true`
- Uses OpenAI Vision API (GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini)
- Respects plan limits (`max_ai_tagging_per_month`)
- Creates candidates in `asset_metadata_candidates` table
- Flows into existing `AiMetadataSuggestionJob` for suggestion generation

**Current State:** AI metadata generation is NOT yet implemented. The `ai_eligible` flag is configured, but no AI analysis occurs. This phase will implement the missing AI generation layer.

## Implementation Notes

### Permission System (Updated: January 2025)

**Owner/Admin Bypass:**
- Owners and admins automatically have full access to manage all metadata fields
- Permission checks in `TenantMetadataRegistryController` and `TenantMetadataFieldController` bypass for owner/admin roles
- `MetadataPermissionResolver` returns `true` for owners/admins by default (except system-locked fields)
- System-locked fields (`population_mode = 'automatic'` AND `readonly = true`) remain non-editable even for owners/admins

**System-Locked Fields:**
- Fields with `population_mode = 'automatic'` AND `readonly = true` are never editable by users
- These fields are automatically populated by the system and cannot be manually overridden
- Examples: `orientation`, `color_space`, `resolution_class`, `dimensions`

### Automatic Field Configuration

**Seeder: `MetadataFieldPopulationSeeder`**
- Configures system fields that are automatically populated
- Sets `population_mode = 'automatic'` for fields like orientation, color_space, resolution_class, dimensions
- Configures visibility: `show_on_upload = false`, `show_on_edit = true`, `show_in_filters = true`
- Sets `readonly = true` to prevent manual editing
- Included in `DatabaseSeeder` to run automatically on fresh installs

**Upload Form Exclusion:**
- `UploadMetadataSchemaResolver` automatically excludes fields with `population_mode = 'automatic'`
- Also excludes fields with `show_on_upload = false`
- These fields never appear in the upload form UI

## Exit Criteria

Phase C is complete when:
- Admins can fully observe system metadata
- Tenants can safely extend metadata
- No schema drift occurs
- Governance rules are explicit and enforceable
